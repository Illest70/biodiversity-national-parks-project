Biodiversity National Parks Project
Project Description
The Biodiversity National Parks Project is a data analysis and visualization project that focuses on the biodiversity in various national parks. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, this project cleans, analyzes, and visualizes data related to species observations and conservation statuses.

The aim of the project is to gain insights into the distribution and conservation status of species within the parks, providing valuable information for environmental research and conservation efforts.

Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and duplicates to ensure data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides summary statistics and visualizations for better understanding of the data.

Visualizations:

Distribution plots for conservation statuses.

Bar plots of species by category.

Heatmaps for species and observations by park.

Bar plots for total observations by species.

Endangered Species Analysis: Filters and lists endangered species along with their scientific names, common names, and categories.

Demonstrating Familiarity with Data Optimization
This project showcases proficiency in data optimization through several key aspects:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from missing values and duplicates, which enhances data quality and accuracy.

Efficient Data Handling: Utilizing Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

Optimized Visualizations: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create clear and informative visualizations that help in drawing meaningful insights.

Performance Optimization: Employing techniques such as pivot tables and group-by operations to streamline data analysis and reduce computational load.
